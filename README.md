This is my shot at making minesweeper like game.
The main goal of this project was to learn basics of Windows Forms,
and also improve my C# knowladge.

The goal is to mark all the bombs in grid with flags (Mouse: RightClick)

At the same time player has to reveal all not-bomb fields.
Once set flag can only be removed by RightClicking it again.
Player reaveals fields by left clicking.

If player left clicks bomb field, he loses the game and all fields are revealed.
